# DiceSimulator
## Description 
It is a simple python project for beginners who just started working with python language. We have used just one library in our code (i.e. random) to generate random numbers so as to make sure about the distinctness of the number and decreasing the probability of getting the same number.

## Application 
Can be used as a reference program to understand how the conditional statements, looping statements, libraries, wtc. work.
As a real-time application, it can be used as a replacement for a regular dice 
It can heplful in analysing how the input is taken and the output is generated.
    And all of this can be done with very simple and a basic set of instructions..
   
## Working of the code
When you use the given code, you just have to tap "y" to roll the dice everytime you want after running the code. And as a result, it will give you the different numbers everytime, simulation a regular dice

## Questions
Can it be used in an App? If so, how can we integrate it?
